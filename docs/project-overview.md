# Neuron Log Project Overview

## Project Description

Neuron Log is a web application designed to serve as a personal "Second Brain" tool focused on capturing structured daily shutdown reflections. The goal is to create a system that helps users log what they accomplished, what's in progress, what's blocking them, what they need to do tomorrow, and any loose thoughts. This structured approach to daily reflection helps in:

1. **Organizing thoughts and work progress**
2. **Reducing mental load** by externalizing information
3. **Tracking progress** over time
4. **Managing blockers and dependencies**
5. **Planning effectively** for the next day

The project follows modern web development practices, with a clean separation of concerns, strong typing with TypeScript, and a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Core Concept

The core concept of Neuron Log is the "daily shutdown" - a structured process at the end of each workday to:

- Record accomplishments to track progress
- Document in-progress items and their current status
- Identify blockers and needed resources
- Capture decisions that need to be made and who needs to be involved
- Plan priorities for the next day
- Record loose thoughts and ideas
- Complete a workspace cleanup checklist
- Execute a shutdown ritual to mentally disconnect from work

This process helps users maintain clarity, reduce stress, and improve productivity by creating a reliable system for managing information outside of their minds.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:

- **User Authentication**: Email/password authentication using Supabase Auth
- **Daily Log Form**: A structured form with collapsible sections for different types of information
- **History View**: A timeline of past logs with the ability to view details of any log
- **Data Storage**: Structured JSON data stored in Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

The project follows the Next.js App Router pattern:

- `app/`: Contains all Next.js pages and layouts
  - `components/`: Reusable React components
  - `lib/`: Utilities, types, and API clients
  - `styles/`: Global styles
- `public/`: Static assets

## Data Model

The core data model is a `DailyLog` that contains:

```typescript
interface LogData {
  date: string;
  accomplished: string[];
  in_progress: string[];
  not_done_reasoning: Record<string, string>;
  blockers: BlockerItem[];
  decisions_needed: DecisionNeededItem[];
  tomorrow_priorities: string[];
  loose_thoughts: string[];
  cleanup: CleanupStatus;
  shutdown_ritual: string;
}
```

This structured approach allows for consistent data representation and future analysis capabilities.

## Development Roadmap

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, minimal UI that focuses on content
2. **Flexibility**: Adapts to different user workflows
3. **Performance**: Fast loading and response times
4. **Reliability**: Data integrity and consistent experience
5. **Privacy**: Secure user data with proper authentication

## Target Users

Neuron Log is designed for:

- Knowledge workers
- Project managers
- Developers
- Researchers
- Students
- Anyone seeking to organize their work and thoughts with a structured system

By maintaining this structured approach to daily reflection, users can reduce cognitive load, improve focus, and maintain better work-life boundaries.
