## Architecture Overview

Neuron Log follows a modern web application architecture with:

1. **Client-Side Rendering**: React components rendered on the client for interactive UI
2. **Server Components**: Using Next.js App Router for efficient delivery of content
3. **Backend as a Service**: Supabase provides authentication, database, and storage
4. **Type-Safe Data Flow**: TypeScript ensures consistent data structures

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Next.js App Router**: Chosen for its file-based routing, server components, and modern React support
- **Supabase**: Selected as the backend to simplify development with ready-made auth and database services
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling to enable rapid UI development and consistent design
- **TypeScript**: Employed throughout the application for type safety and improved developer experience
- **Component Modularity**: Components are designed to be reusable and focused on specific functionality

### Data Flow

1. User authentication through Supabase Auth
2. Protected routes accessible only to authenticated users
3. Data stored in Supabase PostgreSQL database with JSONB columns for flexible structure
4. Row-level security policies ensure users can only access their own data

### Next Steps for Architecture Enhancement

1. **Implement Server Actions**: For more efficient data mutations
2. **Add Edge Functions**: For server-side processing (reminders, exports)
3. **Improve Error Handling**: More robust error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
4. **Optimize Performance**: Add caching strategies for frequently accessed data
5. **Enhance Security**: Add CSRF protection and additional security headers
